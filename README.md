# Flask Web Application

## Description

Navigating the complexities of buying a house could be easier if users could see immediately an interactive dashboard showing them the range of property prices in neighbourhoods they could be interested in on a map.


## Objective: 

To create three visualizations that show:

•	Range of house prices, red being the most expensive, yellow being the median prices and green being the cheapest available using a HeatMap.

•	A Clustermap showing the available houses for sale in the area.

•	D3 Scatterplot would show relationships between the data values

## Visuals
 
Screenshots of how a user can select visualisation options: Update with pics after project is complete and run. This will give the user directions on how to use the program.

## Tools and Libraries Used:

•	BeautifulSoup

•	D3.js.

•	Leaflet

•	Javascript

•	Jupyter Notebook

•	Mapbox

•	Mongo DB

•	Python

•	Flask

•	Web scraping
